== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the plug-in? =

Easy: Add the shortcode [slider title="slider button title"]slider note content[/slider] to your post or page (or in text widgets, if you enabled processing shortcodes there).

= Why are there no options? =

This was a deliberate decision, with the following reasoning:

* For a typical blog site, the CSS definitions are unlikely to change, or change frequently, so it is basically a one-time effort for the administrator.
* On the other hand, having extra options is an run-time overhead that occurrs on every page load, so it's an "every-time" penalty for each and every of your visitors.
* Any customization I can think of right now is related to CSS styling. There already exists [a plug-in that allows for extra CSS styling from within the WordPress' admin interface - MyCSS](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mycss/), so why re-invent the wheel, and add another stylesheet file to load on page displays?
